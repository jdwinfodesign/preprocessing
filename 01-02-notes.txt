	01-topic-chunk-output.ditamap
is pretty much the same as
	02-get-figs.ditamap

	02-get-figs.xsl
pretty much just extracts the figs out of the ".//document(@href)//fig" apply-templates rule in the chapter template
	02-get-figs.xml is the output
	
I have been using this as the input for 03-num-figs, because no build target in the transformation produces temporary output with equivalent content 

03-num-figs.xsl simply numbers the figs and outputs 03-num-figs.xml
